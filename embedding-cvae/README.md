# Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) models with PyTorch Lightning

Implementations of CVAE architectures with PyTorch lightning

* `01_lightning-cvae` - Simple Convolutional CVAE for the MNIST digit data
* `02_embedding-cvae` - CVAE model using embeddings as conditional variables (Based on the paper: [Population-level integration of single-cell datasets enables multi-scale analysis across samples](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-02035-2))
