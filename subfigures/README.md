# Matplotlib subfigures

This repository contains all the code for my article ["A Guide to Matplotlib Subfigures for Creating Complex Multi-Panel Figures"](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-matplotlib-subfigures-for-creating-complex-multi-panel-figures-70fa8f6c38a4) on Towards DataScience

One notebook with all code and a python script separately for each plot.
